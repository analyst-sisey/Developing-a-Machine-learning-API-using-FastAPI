# Developing-a-Machine-learning-API-using-FastAPI
This project creates an API that is requested to interact with a ML model. The model is ML model that predicts the survivors of the famous titanic disaster.

This is an interesting solution when you want to keep your model architecture secret or to make your model available to users already having an API. By creating an API, and deploying it, your model can easily receive request using the internet protocol as presented by the illustration below.
